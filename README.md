# Tetris
My small tetris reimplamentation. I used four 64-pixel pannels as a display and serial port to move the brick around.
## "Features"
- Counts and displays ploints at the end
- Generates random bricks
- Uses simmilar points system as the original version - the more rows you destry at the same time, the more points you get

If you want to try this out, I highly suggest using PlatformIO serial monitor since it sends characters as soon as they are typed. You can check pins in the `config.hpp` file.
